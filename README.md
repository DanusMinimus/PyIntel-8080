# PyIntel-8080
This is a intel 8080 emulator written in python, it is poorly documented and badly written. I intend to fix this but anyone can take insperation from it if they would like.

TODO:
Implement code by Pyhon code standards
Remove hardcoded intermidates
Create proper documentation
Make screen animations work properly
