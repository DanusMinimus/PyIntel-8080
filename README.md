# PyIntel-8080
This is a Intel 8080 emulator written in python, it is poorly documented and badly written. I intend to fix this but anyone can take insperation from it if they would like.

TODO:
1. Implement code by Pyhon code standards
2. Remove hardcoded intermidates
3. Create proper documentation
4. Make screen animations work properly
